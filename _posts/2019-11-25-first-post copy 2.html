description:    Gavin Rugama is a graphic designer who will bring fresh ideas to the industry. 
He is skilled in package design, business promo (client cards, brochures, billboards, 
magazine ads), photography, and logo design. Currently he is a third year student attending 
the graphic design program that’s hosted at St. Clair’s downtown campus Centre for the Arts.
He draws inspiration when listening to instrumental music orchestrated by Hans Zimmer and from 
his fellow designers who are always striving to develop new and original designs. Gavin was 
born and raised in Windsor, Ontario. He comes from a family of six consisting of himself, his 
parents, his two younger sisters, and a younger brother. In his spare time he enjoys reading 
manga, taking photos, camping, biking, watching supernatural or sci-fi television series, and 
spending time with loved ones. His goal is to someday become a creative director and create his 
own business whose mission is to bring more focus and business to an area he feels has much to 
offer.
